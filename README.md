This project is a web-based R Shiny application inspired by the style and functionality of ClustVis (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/clustvis/). It represents an initial prototype, currently focused on providing basic yet useful features for omics data visualization.

**Key Features:**
- File Upload & Data Preview: Upload your own .*csv* files and explore the contents directly within the app.

- Heatmap Visualization: Generate and customize interactive heatmaps using your input data.

- Correlation Plot: Visualize and personalize correlation matrices to explore relationships between variables.

An example dataset (*example_data.csv*) is included for demonstration purposes and testing the application.

Required R Packages:
- shiny
- shinythemes
- shinyWidgets
- corrplot
- ComplexHeatmap
